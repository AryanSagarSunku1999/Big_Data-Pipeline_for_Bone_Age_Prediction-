Big Data Pipeline for Bone Age Prediction

A Big Data pipeline for bone age prediction processes large volumes of medical imaging data—such as hand X-rays—to estimate a patient’s skeletal maturity. The pipeline typically begins with data ingestion from hospital databases or imaging centers, followed by preprocessing steps like image normalization, augmentation, and annotation. The cleaned data is then fed into distributed storage systems (e.g., Hadoop HDFS or cloud storage). Feature extraction and model training—often using deep learning frameworks—are performed at scale using tools like Apache Spark or TensorFlow. The final stage involves real-time or batch-based inference, integrating the results into healthcare systems to assist radiologists in accurate age assessment.
